    "\n",
    "Early stopping is a regularization technique for iterative optimization algorithms such as Graient Descent that stops training as soon as the validation error reaches a minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we start with weights almost zero and they move away as training continues, stopping early corresponds to a model with more weights close to zero and effectively fewer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Stopping Curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "With Stochastic (and Mini-batch) Gradient Descent, the error vs iterations (epochs) curves are not so smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be hard to know whether we have reached the minimum or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to stop only after the validation error has been above the minimum for some time (when we are confident that the model will not do any better), then roll back the model parameters to the point where the validation error was at a minimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, due to its stochastic (i.e., random) nature, this algorithm is much less regular than Batch Gradient Descent: instead of gently decreasing until it reaches the minimum, the cost function will bounce up and down, decreasing only on average. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time it will end up very close to the minimum, but once it gets there it will continue to bounce around, never settling down. So once the algorithm stops, the final parameter values are good, but not optimal.\n"

    "For implementing SGD for Logistic Regression, we usually use the \"log\" loss. The \"log\" loss gives logistic regression, a probabilistic classifier.\n",
